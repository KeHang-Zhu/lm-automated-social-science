Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We are going to run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are running this simulation on a computer, so we need to determine how the agents will interact.
e have determined that there is one central agent and then all other agents. The center agent speaks every other time with a random non-central agent.
Please select which agent should be the central agent.
Respond with a JSON in the following format:
{{ '{' }}"central agent": choice which agent is central,
"explanation": "explanation for choice"{{ '}' }}
