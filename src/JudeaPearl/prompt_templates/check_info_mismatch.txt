Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We are going to run a simple simulation of this scenario multiple times with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
Explicitly, we are interested in how the following causes: "{{ causes }}" affect these outcomes variables: {{outcomes}}.
In each round of the simulation, we are going to vary one value of one of the causes to perform a perfectly randomized experiment to determine the causal effects of the varied cause on the outcomes.
Here is a python dictionary the specifies the variation that we will induce in each of the causes: {{ varied_attribute_dict }}.
The dictionary is structured such that each main key is the name of a cause, with values that are also dictionaries.
In each of these subdictionaries is the attribute for a given agent that will be varied along a corresponding list of values.
These varied values are the variations in the experiment and they are the most important pieces of information for each of the agents.
However, the agents will need other information to realistically participat in the simulation.
We need to generate the minimum amount of necessary background information to tell the agents so that they can participate in the scenario and we create the appropriate experiment to actually test the relationship between the causes and the outcomes.
We will determine this for one agent at a time and are going to determine it for this agent right now {{ agent }}
We have determined that the goal of the {{ agent }} is: {{ goal }}.
The {{ agent }} faces this constraint: {{ constraint }}.
Additionally, we have another set of attributes with their corresponding values that we are going to add to the agent: {{ info_attributes }}.
However, we need to make sure that this set of attributes and values ({{ info_attributes }}) are consistent with other agents information in the scenario.
These agent(s) already have information that we have deemed is consistent: {{ consistent_info_attributes }}
If any of the values of the attributes: ({{ info_attributes }}) are inconsistent with the attributes that we have deemed consistent: {{ consistent_info_attributes }},
then update the inconsistent values: {{attribute_values}} for the attributes for the {{ agent }} to be consistent.
A few things to note:
1. Some of the attributes from the agents that have been deemed consistent attributes might not be relevant to {{ attribute_names }}, just ignore these.
2. Take into account the context with what is reasonable to make attributes match when appropriate. 
Often making attributes consistent just requires making them the same as the already consistent ones.
For example, if the scenario is "Interviewing for a job" and the consistent agent is the "interviewee" and the attribute value pair is "the job" : "software engineer",
then if the agent we are checking is the interviewer, the interview should have the same value of the job they are interviewing as the interviewee is interviewing because they're in the same scenario.
3. Take into account the context with what is reasonable to make relatedly different when appropriate.
For example, if the scenario is "two people bargaining over a mug" and the consistent agent is the "buyer" and the attribute value pair is "value of the mug" : "10",
then if the agent we are checking is the seller and they also have a "value of the mug attribute", then the seller's value for the mug should be higher than the buyer's so that a deal could actually occur!
It wouldn't be very interesting to have a buyer and seller negotiating if the seller values something at 10000 and the buyer values the same thing at 10.
4. All the attributes might already be consistent. In that case, just return the original attribute values: {{ info_attributes }} as a json in the form required below.
5. It is especially important that the values the additional attributes {{attribute_names}} do not conflict with any of the possible values for the varied attributes: {{varied_attributes}}, since these are the parameters if the simulation we are most interested in.
Please respond with a json in this form and make sure that each string is in double quotes. Do not change the names of any attributes, only their values if they're inconsistent.
