    In the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}",
    We have identified the following DAG of causal relationships between variables: "{{ dag }}"
    Who are the individual human agents in this scenario? They should have specified roles.
    Respond with a list of inidividual human agents, with the roles as their titles, separated by a semi-colon.
    For example, if the scenario was "a criminal case" the correct response would be:
    judge; defendant; prosecutor; defense attorney; jurer 1; jurer 2;
    And the following would be incorrect: 
    judge; defendant; lawyers; jurers

    In the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}",
    We have identified the following DAG of causal relationships between variables: "{{ dag }}".
    We have also identified the following individual human agents: "{{ human_agents }}" relevant to the DAG and scenario.
    What information do we need to know about each agent if we are running an experiment to test the DAG.
    Please only include information that will be explicitly relevant to the DAG.
    Respond with a json in the following format:
    {"agent_name1": ["information1", "information2", "information3"],
     "agent_name1": ["information1", "information2", "information3"]}

    In the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}",
    We have identified the following DAG of causal relationships between variables: "{{ dag }}".
    We have also identified the following individual human agents: "{{ human_agents }}" relevant to the DAG and scenario.
    We are going to run a simulated experiment where we instantiate each agent as a large language model.
    We want to provide each relevant agent with the minimum possible information so that they can successfully simulate the experiment.
    We are then going to adjust the information we provide to each agent to see how it affects the outcome of the experiment relevant to the DAG.

    In the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}",
    We have identified the following DAG of causal relationships between variables: "{{ dag }}".
    We have also identified the following individual human agents: "{{ human_agents }}" relevant to the DAG and scenario.
    We are going to run a simulated experiment where we instantiate each agent as a large language model.
    We are going to endow each agent with the following information: "{{ agent_info }}" to see how it affects the outcome of the experiment to test the DAG.
    How should we vary the information we provide to each agent for different simulations of the experiment?
    For example, if we wanted to test how emotion affects the outcome of the experiment, we could vary the emotion of each agent.
    The emotion variable would always be an attribute of the agent, but it's value would be varied.
    We will only vary information that can be adjusted before the experiment is run.
    For example, we will not vary the information that is learned during the experiment (like varying how happy the agent is after the experiment is run).
    It may be that some agents do not need to have any of their information varied.
    Please only include information that will be explicitly relevant to the DAG.

    We have identified the following DAG of causal relationships between variables: "{{ dag }}".
    We have also identified the following individual human agents: "{{ human_agents }}" relevant to the DAG and scenario.
    We have the following information about each agent: "{{ agent_info }}" that is necessary to run an experiment to test the DAG.
    Does the information for each agent map to a variable in the DAG?
