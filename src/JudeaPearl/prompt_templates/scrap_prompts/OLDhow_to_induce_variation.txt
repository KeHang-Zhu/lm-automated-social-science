Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We are goint to run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are interested in measuring the quantity of the variable: "{{ variable_name }}".
We have decided to operationalize the variable and measure it's quantity in the following way: "{{ operationalization }}".
We have determined that this is a/an {{ variable_type }} variable.
We have also determined that when measured, the variable has these units: "{{ units }}",.
We are trying to measure the effect of changing {{ variable_name }} on {{ relevant_outcome }}.
We have also identified the following possible covariate(s): {{ covariates }}.
How could we systematically vary {{ variable_name }} to test the effect in multiple simulations assuming that we can control the attributes of all human agents in the scenario?
A few things things to remember in your response:
1. The variation should be set based on the variable's possible levels: {{ levels }}
Each level should be used once.
2. The induced variation must come endowing the agent with some attribute that does not conflict with attributes that might effect the covariate(s).
For example, if the scenario is "negotiating to buy a car", the relevant outcome variable is "price of the deal", and the variable we want to induce variation on is "financial resources of the buyer",
then a good attribute to endow the agent would be "annual income" and one could induce variation by giving one buyer "annual income":"25,000", another buyer "annual income":"50,000", etc.
3. If the levels of values have a range for the variation, you must choose one value in each range for that level. 
For example, the induced variation for your annual income should not be: "annual income": ["0-20,000", "20,001-40,000", "40,001-60,000", "60,001-80,000", "80,001 and above"], but could be: "annual income": ["15,000", "35,000", "50,000", "62,0000", "100,000"]
4. If the levels are a scale that corresponds to a latent variable, the induced variation should be in terms of words that associate to the variable and not the number of the scale.
This is extremely important because it does not make sense to tell a human that they are "a happiness level 3" without context
For example, the induced variation for a happiness scale from 1-3 where 1 is sad and 3 is happy should not be: "happiness_level":["1","2","3"], but should be: "happiness_level":["sad","neutral","happy"].
A good rule of thumb is that numerical descriptions should only be used to induce variation for continuous variables and count variables.
5. You must choose the agent that is relevant for inducing the variation based on the selected attribute.
6. The name of the attribute should not reference the agent in the 3rd person since we will be telling the agents their attributes directly.
7. The attributes will be given to the agents before the simulation, so if the attributes induced variation is about a current state of being, the wording should be in the present tense.
8. Attribute name must make sense to the agent without very much context as they will be given directly to the agent.


## things must be prescriptive! For example, if var is communication skills don't say "quality of conversations" would want to vary the "conversational Ability" 

DEAL WITH THE #SERIOUS BIDDERS PROBLEM OF OUTCOMES! hard to vary across


For example, if the scenario is "negotiating to buy a car", the relevant outcome variable is "price of the deal", and the variable we want to induce variation on is "financial resources of the buyer",
the attribute name should not be "buyer's annual income", but could be "your annual income" or "annual income".
Format your response as a json dictionary.
There should be a key for the name/short description of the agent's attribute that will be varied to induce the varation in the variable of interest, a key for the relevant agent's name and an "explanation" key.
Here is the example format:
{{ '{' }}"current mood": "["sad", "slightly sad", "neutral", "slightly happy", "happy"],
"varied agent": "name of the agent"
"explanation": "explanation attribute choice, variation description, and agent"{{ '}' }}
