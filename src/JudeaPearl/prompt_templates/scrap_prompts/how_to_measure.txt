Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
If we had just run a a simple simulation with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other,
How would we measure the value of the variable: "{{ variable_name }}"?
All methods to measure a variable should involve asking one or more of the agents for information,
or asking an external agent who can both read the transcript of the simulation or look at agents answers to questions.
For example, if you wanted to measure the variable "agent satisfaction" you could ask an agent "how satisfied are you?".
Respond with a json in the following format:
{{ '{' }}"variable_name": ["way to measure variable", "way to measure variable"]{{ '}' }}
