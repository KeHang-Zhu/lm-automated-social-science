    In the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}",
    We have hypothesed that following DAG represents the causal relationships between the variables: {{ dag }}.
    How would we measure the values of the {{ variable_type }} variable: "{{ variable_name }}" 
    if we had just run a a simple simulation with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other?
    For example, if you wanted to measure the variable "happiness" you could ask the agent "how happy are you?".
    Respond with a json in the following format:
    {"<variable_name>": "[<way to measure variable 1>, <way to measure variable 2>]"}

    In the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}",
    We have hypothesized that following DAG represents the causal relationships between the variables: {{ dag }}.
    However, we are not sure if our variables in the model are latent or observable.
    Please check if the {{ variable_type }} variable: "{{ variable_name }}" is latent or oberservable.
    For example, the variable "how much money a deal occured for" is observable, but the variables "aggressiveness of the buyer" or skill at storytelling" are latent if the scenario is "negotiating to buy a car".
    Note that we are going to measure the {{ variable_type }} variable: "{{ variable_name }}",
    by one of these methods: "{{ measurements }}".
    It's important to note that one sign an observable variable is that it can be measured by a human agent perfectly (like asking "how much money did the deal occur for?" or "how much is the car worth to you exactly?").
    Conversely, a sign that a variable is latent is that it can only be measured imperfectly (like asking "how aggressive is the buyer?" or "how good is the buyer at storytelling on a scale of 1-5?").
    Your response should use the same json format as the DAG: {{ dag }}, except that you should update 
    each variable with a new key like to indicate it if it is latent or observable like this:
    {
            "X1": {
                "children": ["Y1"]
            },
            "X2": {
                "children": ["Y1"]
            },
            "{{ variable_name }}": {
                "latent": <true or false>,
                "children": ["Y1"]
            },
            "Y1": {
                "children": ["Y2"]
            },
            "Y2": {
                "children": []
            }
        }
    Do not add or change the latent key for any other variables and do not include any other text in your response.

    Please check if the json delimited by ### is valid. Make sure that it is the right format and that all keys are double quoted.
    If the json is valid, print the original json. If the json is invalid for any reason, fix the json and print the fixed json.
    Here is the json:
    ###
    {{ json }}
    ###
    Do not incude any other text in your response besides the json.
