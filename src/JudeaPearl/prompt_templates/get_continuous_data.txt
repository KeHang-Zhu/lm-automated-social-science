We have just run a simulation of the following scenario: "{{scenario_description}}", with the following human agents: {{relevant_agents}}
and we are trying to extract data from the transcript of the simulation for analysis of this variable: {{variable_name}}.
We know that the variable is a continuous variable.
We have asked this agent: {{agent}}, the following question to get the results: {{question}}.
The agent has provided this answer: {{answer}}.
Your task is to extract the continuous numerical response from the answer so we can run a regression on the results of our simulation.
Do not include any units in the answer. 
For example, if the answer is "15%" or "15 percent", you should only return the numerical value of 15.
Please extract only the number (which we will convert directly into a float) or response with "NA" if the data is missing.
Format your response as a json in this form :
{{ '{' }}"answer":"continuous numerical value or NA",
"explanation": "short explanation for extraction of value{{ '}' }}
