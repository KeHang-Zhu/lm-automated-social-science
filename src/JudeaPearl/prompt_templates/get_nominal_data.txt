We have just run a simulation of the following scenario: "{{scenario_description}}", with the following human agents: {{relevant_agents}}
and we are trying to extract data from the transcript of the simulation for analysis of this variable: {{variable_name}}.
We know that the variable is a nominal variable".
We have asked this agent: {{agent}}, the following question to get the results: {{question}}.
The agent has provided this answer: {{answer}}.
The nominal variable can take on these values: {{levels}}, which will map to these numeric value or data analysis: {{level_values}}
Your task is to extract the correct numeric value from the agent's answer so we can run a regression on the results of our simulation.
Please extract only the number (which we will convert directly into a int) from this list: {{level_values}} that corresponds to the agents response of the levels here:{{levels}}.
please respond with "NA" if the data is missing.
If there is more than one answer, pick the best one or respond with "NA". Do not respond with multiple values.
Format your response as a json in this form :
{{ '{' }}"answer":"numerical value from this list: {{level_values}} corresponding to these levels: {{levels}} for the nominal respose or NA",
"explanation": "short explanation for extraction of value{{ '}' }}
