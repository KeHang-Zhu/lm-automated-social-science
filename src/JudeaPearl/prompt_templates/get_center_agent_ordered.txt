Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We are going to run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are running this simulation on a computer, so we need to determine how the agents will interact.
We have determined that there is one central agent and then all other agents. The non-central agents have an order, but the order alternates with the center agent (like an auction).
Please select which agent should be the central agent and select the order of the non-central agents.
Please determine the central agent and order of the non-central agents that that they should speak to make the simulation as realistic as possible.
Every agent must be included - one agent as the central, the rest in the ordered list.
Respond with a JSON in the following format:
{{ '{' }}"central agent": choice which agent is central,
"order": ["order of non-central agents as a list"]
"explanation": "explanation for choice"{{ '}' }}
