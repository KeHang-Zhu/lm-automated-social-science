Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We are going to run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are interested in measuring the quantity of the variable: "{{ variable_name }}".
We have decided to operationalize the variable and measure its quantity in the following way: "{{ operationalization }}".
We have determined that this is a {{ variable_type }} variable.
We have also determined that when measured, the variable has these units: "{{ units }}".
We are trying to measure the effect of changing "{{ variable_name }}" on the following variable: "{{ descendant_outcomes }}".
We have decided to induce variation on "{{ variable_name }}" by endowing the "{{ varied_agent }}" with this attribute: {{varied_attribute}}.
We are then going to rerun the simulation {{variation_number}} times, each time with a different value for this attribute: {{varied_attribute}}.
We are trying to decide which values to use for inducing variation in the attribute, we have tentatively chosen these: {{varied_attribute}}:{{attribute_values}}.
However, we also have other variables that we are inducing variation at the same time to run multiple experiments at once.
We are inducing variation in these other variables: {{other_variables}}.
And we are inducing variation in these variables through these attributes, values, and agents respectively for each other variables: {{other_variable_info}}
We want to make sure that these controlled values overlap appropriately in order to determine the effects of the variables on the outcomes in the experiment.
For example, if the scenario is "two people bargaining over a mug", the outcome is "whether a deal happens", and there are two causes that we are inducing variation on:
The seller's value of the mug, which we operationalize as the attribute "your value for the mug in dollars" 
and the buyer's budget for the mug which we operationalize as "your budget" to the buyer, then we want our values for the value and the budget to be in a similar range.
We wouldn't want the seller's values to be varied over [$50, $100, $200, $300, $400] and the buyer's budget to be varied over [$5, $10, $15, $20, $25],
because then the seller's value for the mug will always be higher than the buyer's budget,
there will probably never be a deal and it will appear as though these variables don't matter even though they probably do matter.
A better combination of values to test would be to make sure the seller values the mug varied over [$5, $10, $15, $20, $25] - similarly to the buyer.
Another example is if the scenario is "an auction with 2 bidders for a piece of art" and the outcome is "the final price of the auction".
If the two causal variables are "bidder 1's value for the art" and "bidder 2's value for the piece of art",
then we want to make sure that these are in a similar range for their variations.
Otherwise, we might get a false negative when measuring the causal effect of the causes on the final price of the deal.
Please check and decide whether the values {{attribute_values}} are aligned for {{varied_attribute}} with the values for the other variables: "{{other_variables}}" as described above. 
It's important to note that there should be at least 7 values.
If they are appropriately aligned and less than 7 of them, add a few to make at least 7 values.
If they are not aligned, please select new or expanded values (at least 7).
If they are appropriately aligned and there are at least 7, reprint them.
Here is an example JSON that's in the correct format with double quotes:
{{ '{' }}
"attribute_values": [list of new/expanded values or copy previous list if it's good],
"explanation": "short explanation for changing the values or keeping them the same{{ '}' }}
