You have just supplied the following response: "{{previous_response}}" to the task in triple backticks below. 
With this response in mind please double check to make sure you have followed the guidelines presented by the original question.
In particular, you should make sure to pay attention to the following, which is often easy to mess up and you must fix: if the levels are a scale that corresponds to an ordinal variable, the induced variation should be in terms of words that associate to the variable and not the number of the scale.
This is extremely important because it does not make sense to tell a human that a car is "car qaulity level 3" without context---AND THE AGENT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED ANY OTHER CONTEXT BESIDES YOUR RESPONSE.
For example, the induced variation for a car quality scale from 1-3 where 1 is low quality and 3 is high quality should not be: "car quality level":["1","2","3"], but should be: "car quality level":["bad","decent","good"] "car quality level":["1","2","3"] does not makes sense if the agent does not know what the numbers stand for.
With this response in mind and these additional directions please double check to make sure you have followed the guidelines presented by the original question.
It is very important that all of the instructions within the triple backticks are followed.
