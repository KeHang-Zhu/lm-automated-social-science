We are going to run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are interested in measuring the quantity of the variable: "{{ variable_name }}".
We have decided to operationalize the variable and measure its quantity in the following way: "{{ operationalization }}".
We have determined that this is continuous variable.
We have also determined that when measured, the variable has these units: "{{ units }}".
We are trying to measure the effect of changing {{ variable_name }} on the following variable(s): {{ descendant_outcomes }}.
To do this, we are running a randomized controlled trial inducing variation on this agent: {{ agent }}
We have induced variation through a single attribute of the agent that maps to these levels: {{ levels }}.
