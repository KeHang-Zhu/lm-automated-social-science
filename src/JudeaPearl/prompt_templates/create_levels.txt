Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We have just run a simple experimental simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are interested in measuring the quantity of the variable: "{{ variable_name }}".
We have decided to operationalize the variable and measure its quantity in the following way: "{{ operationalization }}".
We have determined that this is a/an {{ variable_type }} variable.
We have also determined that when measured, the variable has these units: "{{ units }}".
What are the specific levels this variable can take on?
We want to appropriately measure "{{ variable_name }}" them for data analysis.
A few things to consider:
1. If a variable is continuous, you should create {{ num_cont_lvls }} ordinal levels that are specified by numerical cutoffs in the continuous variables units that are appropriate for data analysis.
For example, even though monetary values can be negative, they usually aren't less than 0 unless the value is a debt.
If a variable is continuous and doesn't technically have a maximum (or minimum) value, then the levels should have an option that indicates "+" or "above (or "-" or "below" if appropriate).
For a example, if the continuous variable was "the price of a mug", the levels should not be: ['0-20', '21-40', '41-60', '61-80', '81-100'], but could be ['0-20', '21-40', '41-60', '61-80', 'above 80'] or ['0-20', '21-40', '41-60', '61-80', '81+']
You should be very careful to not make these levels too large in their jumps. 
For example, if the variable is "the final price of a mug", the levels shouldn't be ['0-50', '50-100', '100-200', '200+'], because almost any reasonably priced mug will be in the bottom level.
Instead, it makes sense to have the levels be ['0-5', '5-10', '10-20', '20+'] since most mugs are below $20.
Other items will have different ranges, but we want to appropriately capture reasonable variability at each level.
2. If a variable is a count, you should create {{ num_cont_lvls }} ordinal levels that are specified by numerical cutoffs in the count variables units that are appropriate for data analysis.
If a variable is a count and doesn't technically have a maximum (or minimum) value, then the levels should have an option that indicates "+" or "above" (or "-" or "below" if appropriate).
For a example, if the count variable was "number of people", the levels should not be: ['0-3', '4-7', '8-10', '11-14'], but could be ['0-3', '4-7', '8-10', 'above 10'] or ['0-3', '4-7', '8-10', '11+']
3. If a variable is ordinal, you should specify all values it can take on unless the number of values is extremely high.
For example, if the ordinal variable is a likert scale from 1-7, the output should be: ["1","2","3","4","5","6","7"].
Another example, if the ordinal variable can be put in categories from "low" to "high', the output should have all possible values in the form of: ["low","medium","high"]
4. If a variable is binary, you should specify both possible values it can take on - the smallest/worst being first and the bigger or better as second.
5. If the levels are indicated by ranges of numbers, each level should always specify the range and not just state the upper or lower bound for each variable.
For example, if the variable "fear level of the agent" is operationalized by being quantified on a scale from 1 (no fear) to 100 (extreme fear),
the levels should not be ["1", "20", "40", "60", "80", "100"], but should be something like: ["1-20", "21-40", "41-60", "61-80", "81-100"]
6. All levels for a given variable must be mutually exclusive.
7. When listing the levels, if the variable is binary, count, continuous, or ordinal, you must always list them from smallest to largest.
