Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We have just run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are interested in measuring the quantity of the variable: "{{ variable_name }}".
We have decided to operationalize the variable and measure its quantity in the following way: "{{ operationalization }}".
We have determined that this is a/an {{ variable_type }} variable.
We have also determined that when measured, the variable has these units: "{{ units }}", 
and if the variable is not continuous, these explicit possible outcome levels: "{{ levels }}".
We need to determine if the variable of interest is latent or observed.
Observed variables are those that can be directly measured, recorded, or observed. 
For example, height, weight, age, or a score on a test are observed variables because you can directly measure these quantities.
Latent variables are those that cannot be directly observed or measured.
They are often constructs or concepts, like intelligence, depression, or satisfaction. 
These variables are usually measured indirectly, through a series of observed variables that are thought to 'tap into' the latent construct.
Is "{{ variable_name }}" latent or observed?
