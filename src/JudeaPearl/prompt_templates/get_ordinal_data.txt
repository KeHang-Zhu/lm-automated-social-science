We have just run a simulation of the following scenario: "{{scenario_description}}", with the following human agents: {{relevant_agents}}
and we are trying to extract data from the transcript of the simulation for analysis of this variable: {{variable_name}}.
We know that the variable is an ordinal variable".
We have asked this agent: {{agent}}, the following question to get the results: {{question}}.
The agent has provided this answer: {{answer}}.
The ordinal variable can take on these values: {{levels}}, which will map to these numeric value or data analysis: {{level_values}}
Your task is to extract the correct ordinal numeric value from the agent's answer so we can run a regression on the results of our simulation.
Please extract only the number (which we will convert directly into a int) from this list: {{level_values}} that corresponds to the agents response of the ordinal levels here:{{levels}}.
please respond with "NA" if the data is missing.
Format your response as a json in this form :
{{ '{' }}"answer":"ordinal numerical value or NA",
"explanation": "short explanation for extraction of value{{ '}' }}
