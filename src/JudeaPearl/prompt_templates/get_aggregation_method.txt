We have just run a simulation of the following scenario: "{{scenario_description}}", with the following human agents: {{relevant_agents}}
and we are trying to extract data from the transcript of the simulation for analysis of this variable: {{variable_name}}.
We know that the variable is a/an {{variable_type}} variable.
We have the current mapping for measurements to data here: {{ level_value_dict }}
We are using multiple measurements to operationalize this variable which we have already gathered as these numerical values: {{ measurements }}.
The measurements are going to be aggregated like this: {{ aggregation_method }}
Your tast is to pick the correct aggregation method for the combine this list of values {{measurements}} which we will directly use to combine the values of of the list into one data point to run regression on this variable.
You must select an aggregation method from this list: ["sum", "max", "min", "mode", "average", "median"].
A few things to consider:
When selecting the way to combine the measurements
1. You should choose "sum" if an only if the aggregation method is to sum all the measurements and do nothing else.
2. You should choose "max" if an only if the aggregation method is to take the max of the measurements and do nothing else.
3. You should choose "min" if an only if the aggregation method is to take the min of the measurements and do nothing else.
4. You should choose "mode" if an only if the aggregation method is to find the mode of the measurements and do nothing else.
5. You should choose "average" if an only if the aggregation method is to find the average of the measurements and do nothing else.
6. You should choose "median" if an only if the aggregation method is to find the median of the measurements and do nothing else.
Format your response as a json in this form :
{{ '{' }}"aggregation":"choice of sum, max, min, mode, average, median",
"explanation": "explanation for method{{ '}' }}
