Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We are going to run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
The agents need constraints in order to be rational.
In order to be rational, what is the constraint for this human agent in the scenario: {{ agent }}?
The agent should have only one constraint at most.
We have already identified the goal for this agent: {{ goal }}.
A few things to note about the constraints:
1. Constraints should only be things that are absolutely necessary for rational behavior and should not be associated with preferences.
For example, if the scenario is "negotiating to buy a car" and the agents are "a buyer" and "a seller",
a constraint for the seller should not be "influenced by emotions", but should be "will not accept a price below seller's value".
2. Constraints need to be about limiting the agent's decision-making and what they say, not about what the agent should do.
3. Constraints cannot be about limiting the time of interactions between agents, but they can be about the number of interactions if that prevents irrational behavior.
For example, a constraint should not be, "do not speak for more than 5 minutes", but could be "do not speak more than 3 times".
4. Constraints cannot be about limiting or affecting interactions between agents because whether two agents interact is a decision that is made by us externally.
All agents will be able to talk to all other agents and will talk to them in an externally determined fashion.
5. Constraints need to be expressed as instructions to the agent in the second person as we tell these constraints directly to the agents.
6. Constraints can only be limiting actions that are completely irrational like accepting a price below the seller's value, or breaking a law, or spending more than the agent's budget.
7. Constraints should be about things that the agent can realistically control in the scenario given their role.
8. Constraints should not be about accommodating other agents wants or needs. 
Agents do not need to be polite, or respect other agent's budgets to be rational, and constraints can only be about limiting irrational behavior.
9. If there is no obviously necessary constraint, then the constraint should be "you have no constraints".
