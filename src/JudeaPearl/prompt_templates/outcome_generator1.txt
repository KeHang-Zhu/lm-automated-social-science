Consider the following scenario: {{ scenario_description }}
What are some interesting outcomes we could measure about a simple simulation of this scenario involving these agents: "{{ agents }}"
All outcomes must occur during or by the end of a single simulation of the scenario.
For example, if the scenario is about a therapy session, then the outcome must be measurable by the end of the session, not the end of all the therapy sessions since the scenario is locally about one session.
They cannot occur before or after the scenario is complete
The agents will not get to repeat the scenario in the future. 
These outcomes should not be explicitly directional. 
For example, if the scenario is "negotiating to buy a car", 
an outcome should not be the "high final price of the car", but should be "final price of the car"
Additionally, outcomes should refer to a single agent in the scenario or the scenario as a whole, but cannot refer to a subset of the agents that involves more than one agent
For example, if the scenario is "negotiating to buy a car", 
an outcome should not be "The satisfaction of the buyer and seller", but should be "the satisfaction of the buyer or "the satisfaction of the seller"
Another example is if the scenario is "a family discussing vacation destinations", then the outcome cannot be "the parent's final choice" since this refers to a subset of the agents not including the children",
instead, it should be "the family's choice of destination"
The outcomes cannot refer to time (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, etc.) although it's fine if they refer to number of statements made by the agents.
Outcomes must be easily operationalized as a continuous, ordinal, count, or binary variables. 
That is, they should easily have numerical proxies.
For example, if the scenario is "a family discussing vacation destinations" then the outcome should not be "the destination" since this is a nominal categorical variable.
Instead it could be something like "the price of the vacation" or "the number of beaches that there should be".
You can be creative with your outcome variables - you do not need to stick to the flavor of these examples, just the rules they highlight.
In general, the most interesting outcomes are about how the main point of the scenario concluded.
For example, if the scenario is "two people bargaining over a mug", the most interesting outcome is "whether or not a deal was made for the mug".
The format of your output should be a python list like this:
["outcome1", "outcome2", "outcome3"]
