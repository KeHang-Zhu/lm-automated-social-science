Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We are going to run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are running this simulation on a computer, so we need to determine how the agents will interact.
We have determined that the agents should speak in a predermined order repeatedly until the simulation finishes.
Please list the agents in the order that that they should speak to make the simulation as realistic as possible.
If it's not obvious what the order should or it doesn't matter what the order is, just pick according to your best judgment.
Every agent must be included.
Respond with a JSON in the following format:
{{ '{' }}"order": ['order of agents as a list'],
"explanation": "explanation for choice"{{ '}' }}
