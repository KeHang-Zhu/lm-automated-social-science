Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
We have just run a simple simulation of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other.
We are interested in measuring the quantity of the variable: "{{ variable_name }}".
We have decided to operationalize the variable and measure its quantity in the following way: "{{ operationalization }}".
We have determined that this is a/an {{ variable_type }} variable.
We have also determined that when measured, the variable has these units: "{{ units }}", 
and if the variable is not continuous, these explicit possible outcome levels: "{{ levels }}".
After the scenario is completed, we are going to ask the following agents the following questions to get the values of the variable from the finished simulation: {{measurement_questions}}.
Sometimes, agent specified for a question will be called 'oracle'.
The 'oracle' is a pseudonym for an external party that can read the text transcript from the scenario and answer questions about it.
We are going to aggregate the answers from these questions like this: {{measurement_aggregation}}
There are some instances where there will be no values for variables after the simulation and the agents will be unable to answer the questions.
For example, if the scenario is "negotiating to buy a car" and the variable of interest was "deal price" and a deal was not reached, then there's no possible deal price to report and the data will be missing
We need you to identify if there are any situations where the data for "{{ variable_name }}" could be missing.
What are the situations where data could be missing?
A few important things to remember:
1. It is possible that the data will not be missing, but we need you to check anyways.
For example, if the scenario were "negotiating to buy a car" and the variable is "age of the buyer", then this data will never be missing because a buyer must have an age.
2. The agents in the scenario will always be present, so you should not use "missing agent" as a reason why there could be missing data.
3. Agents also have perfect memories, always answer honestly, and are forced to answer all questions.
4. If the variable relates to an attribute of an agent like an agent's income or mood, the agent will always have data to provide to questions about the atrributes.
5. The scenario will always begin.
7. The transcription is always perfect and their are never recording errors.
8. You should focus on if the variable will be available within one of the levels: {{ levels }}. 
For example, if the scenario is "negotiating to buy a car" and the variable is "value to the seller" and the value to the seller is $0, this is not missing. The data would be 0.
9. Even if the value of a variable is not available in the transrcipt, if the variable is about the agent, the agent will be able to provide data about the variable.
10. If is not possible for the data to be missing, you should respond "data always present"
11. You must keep the list of reasons why data is missing as short as possible while still being comprehensive.
For example, if the scenario is "negotiating to buy a car" and the variable of interest was "deal price", the missing data situations should not be
["the seller refused to part with the mug", "the buyer didn't want the mug"], but should just be inclusive of both: ["No deal was reached"]
Respond with a json in the following format:
{{ '{' }}"missing_data_situations": ["reason for potentially missing data 1", "reason for potentially missing data 2"],
"explanation": "short explanation potentially missing data"{{ '}' }}
