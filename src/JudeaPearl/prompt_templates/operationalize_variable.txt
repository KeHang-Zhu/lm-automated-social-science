Consider the following scenario: "{{ scenario_description }}".
If we had just run an example of this scenario with these human agents: "{{ relevant_agents }}" interacting with each other,
How would we operationalize the variable: "{{ variable_name }}"?
Some important things to note:
1. The transcript of the scenario will be recorded in text and we can ask the agents questions after the scenario has completed, but there is no other way to gather information about the variable.
2. You must select only one way to operationalize the variable.
3. The operationalization must be explicit about how the variable is quantified.
4. The operationalization must be explicit about how the quantity is obtained, but not overly specific such that it has false negatives
That is, it must be clear where the final quantity is obtained such that someone could replicate the measurement of the quantity easily, but also reasonably.
For example, if the scenario is "two people bargaining over a mug" and the outcome is "whether a deal occurs", then the operationalization should be something like "a binary variable that is 1 when a deal occurs and 0 otherwise".
It should not just be "a binary variable that is 1 when the word 'deal' is used", because a deal can occur with many different types of wordings.
5. The operationalization must translate the variable into a quantity that is singularly defined as binary, continuous, count, ordinal; it cannot belong to more than one of those categories when quantified because we have to choose how to analyze it.
Remember that Ordinal variables are categorical variables with an order. 
All variables must have some sort of ordering.
For example, if a variable is operationalized in categories that are increasing/decreasing like "low", "medium", "high", or "small", "medium", "large", then it is ordinal.
But if it is operationalized as some sort of continuous number, like an amount of money, it's continuous.
6. If a variable is ordinal, it cannot be measured on a scale - all possible values must be explitly determined for operationalization.
For example, if the variable is "level of happiness", then it should not be operationalized as a "scale of happiness from 1-7", but should be operationalizls
ed ordinal categories of like this: "very unhappy", "unhappy", "neutral", "happy", "very happy".
The number of categories is up to your discretion, but it shouldn't generally be more than 5.
7. You cannot say that the value will be "discretionary" or "determined in the future" and must state how it will be quantitatively or categorically defined.
8. If the quantity is obtained through speaking with an agent, the questions for the agents must be explicitly stated.
9. A quantity can be obtained by speaking with more than one agent, but you should try to try to minimize the number of agents and questions when possible.
10. An operationalization and measurement of a variable cannot be based on an external set of rules or an external rubric.
For example, if the variable "knowledge of the surgical procedure" and the operationalization was "the number of correct steps taken in the procedure",
then every possible correct step must be defined. The steps cannot be according to some standard list that is not fully explained - you must describe the steps.
11. You should remember that an operationalization can be done by asking the agents for information, although it doesn't have to be done this way.
For example, if the variable is "number of places the person has visited", this doesn't need to be operationalized as the number of places the person mentions in the scenario (unless that makes the most sense for the operationalization).
It can be operationalized by asking the person how many places they've visited and saving that value if this is the best way to measure the variable.
Conversely, if the variable is "skill of the agent", it makes more sense to get this value based on their statements during the scenario simulation.
12. Some variables might not need much operationalization.
For example, if the variable is "price of a deal", the operationalization is just recording the price since this can be done directly.
Additionally, one can operationalize a variable by asking an agent for information if that is more informative.
13. You must assume that the variable's value is determined by the end of the scenario simulation.
for example, if the scenario is "A family is deciding where to go on vacation", and the variable is "cost of the vacation",
then the operationalization cannot be "how much the family spent on vacation", because the vacation occurs after the scenario simulation completes.
However, the operationalization could be "the average amount each family member expects to spend or wants to spend on vacation" because that could be fully determined during the scenario.
