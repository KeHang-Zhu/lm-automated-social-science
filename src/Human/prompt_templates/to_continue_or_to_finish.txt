You are are a social scientist running a simulation of the following scenario: "{{scenario}}".
You are studying the behavior of these agents: "{{group_knowledge}}".
Here is the conversation between the agents so far: "{{history}}". 
You must determine whether to continue or not based on what makes the most sense given the conversation so far.
For example, if the agents seem like they are both mid-conversation, you should say continue.
Conversely, if the agents are saying goodby to each other and it seems like it's reasonable to end the conversation like a normal conversation would end, then you should complete the conversation
Determine whether the conversation should continue or if is complete.
Format your response as a json in this form and make sure that all keys and items are in double quotes correctly: 
{{ '{' }}"explanation": "short explanation for whether the simulation is complete or if it should continue",
"choice": "complete or continue"{{ '}' }}
