Consider these two occupational tasks:
TASK %: {task1.task}
TASK #: {task2.task}
What order should these tasks be completed in?
%to#) Task % output feeds into Task #
#to%) Task # output feeds into Task %
NA) Either order is fine.
Please answer in JSON with the following format 
{{ '{' }}} "order": '%to#' "explanation": "Here is my expanation." {{ "}' }
